                            <p>
                                Programming is the process of taking an algorithm and encoding it into a notation, a
                                programming language, so that it can be executed by a computer. Although many
                                programming languages and many different types of computers exist, the important first
                                step is the need to have the solution. Without an algorithm there can be no program.
                                Computer science is not the study of programming. Programming, however, is an important
                                part of what a computer scientist does. Programming is often the way that we create a
                                representation for our solutions. Therefore, this language representation and the
                                process of creating it becomes a fundamental part of the discipline.
                            <p>Algorithms describe the solution to a problem in terms of the data needed to represent
                                the problem instance and the set of steps necessary to produce the intended result.
                                Programming languages must provide a notational way to represent both the process and
                                the data. To this end, languages provide control constructs and data types.</p>
                            <p>Control constructs allow algorithmic steps to be represented in a convenient yet
                                unambiguous way. At a minimum, algorithms require constructs that perform sequential
                                processing, selection for decision-making, and iteration for repetitive control. As long
                                as the language provides these basic statements, it can be used for algorithm
                                representation.</p>
