                                CCTV stands for closed-circuit television and is commonly known as video surveillance.
                                “Closed-circuit” means broadcasts are usually transmitted to a limited (closed) number
                                of monitors, unlike “regular” TV, which is broadcast to the public at large. CCTV
                                networks are commonly used to detect and deter criminal activities, and record traffic
                                infractions, but they have other uses.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                CCTV technology was first developed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch
                                of V2 rockets. It was later used by American scientists during the testing of the atomic
                                bomb.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                CCTV surveillance can deter potential criminals. When a crime does occur, video footage
                                can help law enforcement to investigate and later provide evidence for prosecution in a
                                law court. Used in conjunction with CCTV, audio, thermal and other types of sensors can
                                alert officials to occurrences that are out of the ordinary, e.g. a fire or gun shots at
                                a location. For businesses, CCTV cameras can detect and monitor in-house criminal
                                activities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Using CCTV cameras, emergency services and rescue workers are able to assess and monitor
                                events in real time to relay a “situation” via video to disaster management teams, e.g.
                                from inside a burning building, from a cave or from a helicopter flying over a scene.
